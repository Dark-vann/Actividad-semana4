<p>People-pleasing planet
    Got a million people saying how to plan it
    I can no longer stand it
    Gonna spend my days telling them to can it
    Each and to their own
    Got a salesman ringing my phone
    Tell me where to go
    No, I don't wanna hear the down low
    I owe
    Nothing, not a penny, never wanna hear you preach
    No
    Take me to the beach, ah
    You could have the mountains, ah
    You take the snow, ah
    It's way too cold
    My heart is cold enough, ah
    Push comes to shove, ah
    You could have the mountains, ah
    I'll take the beach
    If you want it, come and get it
    Got a million people telling me they're with it
    And they got me at my limit
    And I'm telling you, I never spare a minute
    If you wanna keep on living
    For the sucker that is telling you your limit
    Gotta find out it's a gimmick
    Can't nobody tell you how to live it
    I owe
    Nothing, not a penny, never walking on a leash
    No
    Take me to the beach, ah
    You could have the mountains, ah
    You take the snow, ah
    It's way too cold
    My heart is cold enough, ah
    Push comes to shove, ah
    You could have the mountains, ah
    I'll take the beach
    I'm better off alone
    Like a rolling stone
    Turning off my phone
    No one bringing me down, down, down, down
    Just give me some space
    That sun in my face
    And the days go on, and on, and on, and on (T-A-K-E, T-A-K-E)
    (T-A-K-E)
    Take me to the beach, ah
    You could have the mountains, ah
    You take the snow, ah
    It's way too cold (it's way too cold)
    My heart is cold enough, ah
    Push comes to shove, ah
    You could have the mountains, ah
    I'll take the beach (I'll take the -, I'll take the -)
    Take me to the -
    I don't have no friends, ask anyone
    Got me 'til the end, my favorite one
    Take me to the beach
    I don't have no friends, ask anyone (ask anyone)
    Got me 'til the end, my favorite one
    Take me to the beach</p>
